<p>Just as the earth cycles through the seasons, our energy ebbs and flows, prompting us to synchronize with nature&#8217;s rhythm and coordinate our actions with the cadence of the world we occupy. The fall season is a transition from abundance and outward exertion to inward consolidation and contemplation. In preparation for our winter slumber, we are asked to evaluate what to retain and what to cast aside before the next creative cycle begins. It is no coincidence that so many of the holidays this time of year focus on self-reflection, inward inventory, acknowledging ends, and embracing new beginnings. With each shedding of our old skin, the opportunity for growth increases.</p>
<p>We can feel the winds of change outside, briskly stirring up what is stale and rootless and clearing the space for a crisp new start. While on the surface things appear to be in a state of decline, this stark new landscape is actually a clean slate, full of untapped potential and endless possibility. As leaves start to whither and return to the earth, we too must turn from superficial distractions and reconnect with our core values and beliefs. This period of introspection marks a return home, asking us to begin the slow process of redefining our goals, reevaluating our choices, and connecting with our inherent talents and pressing ambitions.</p>
<p>Fall is the season of the lung, recipient and envoy of the vital force that keeps us alive and inspired. Each breathe is a new opportunity to receive, discern, and release, creating the tempo with which we live our lives and allowing us to be present, fully participating in every moment and experience. The element associated with fall is metal, illuminator of truth. It retains it&#8217;s integrity regardless of the conditions to which it is exposed and unassumingly reveals the elegance and power of simplicity. As we take cue and tune in to our most basic needs, we are given the opportunity for a complete re-set, shedding old beliefs in search of a more resonant truth.</p>
<p>While letting go of the past can be disquieting, it carries the promise of wisdom and insight as we cut the chains of old ideals and begin anew with clear resolve and a fresh sense of purpose. Let us use this precious time to gather our potential, separate out the extraneous and have the courage to become our most magnificent selves.</p>

<p>Spring is a season of such promise and hope, representing rebirth, revision, renewal and action. The channels associated with spring &#8211; the Liver and Gallbladder – are responsible for the smooth flow of energy, furnishing us with the decisiveness to choose our path and the stamina to move forward with confidence, clarity and strength. The element of Wood is symbolic of transformation and expansion, coaxing us to stretch beyond our limits and bring form to the notions pondered in the quiet space of winter. The spirit of the season, the Hun, gives us the internal guidance and intuition to convert our visions into creation.</p>
<p>With all this pent up potential just begging to be unleashed, the transition from winter to spring can be one of the most challenging, and we only need to peek out the window for some insight into why.</p>
<p>Just as the buds sit tightly on the trees, eager to bloom at the sun’s command, we&#8217;ve been waiting patiently for the weather to turn and the energy of our environment to shift and propel us forward. The cruel tease of warmer days, full of false starts and dramatic swings, creates a palpable tension all around us. The more we are stalled, the more stagnant we feel, and this stagnation slows the system down, causing irritability, anger, depression and inaction. To better handle the upheaval and enter your personal spring with grace, try these seasonal tips:</p>
<p><strong>Keep the energy flowing:</strong> Inertia is a hard thing to overcome. Finding the initial motivation to transition from winter contemplation into spring action can feel monumental when the weather is not yet cooperating. The channels associated with spring are both responsible for and in need of smooth movement. When we feel stuck, it mucks up the system and the repercussions affect our whole being, causing a range of emotions from debilitating depression to inexplicable rage and everything in between. The sooner we start moving &#8211; be it forward with a project or physically with our bodies &#8211; the healthier and more fulfilled we will feel.</p>
<p><strong>Protect yourself from pernicious winds:</strong> It always makes me chuckle to read ancient Chinese medicine texts and their description of wind as a nefarious entity, carrying disease into the body. But we are all familiar with that feeling of a quick chill or stiffness to the back of the neck, right before we catch a cold. Or the way the spine seems to stiffen up, right before we throw out our back. Or an uncontrollable body spasm that seems to come out of nowhere. We also know that heavy winds are a hallmark of the start of spring. The easiest way to protect ourselves from whatever the wind may carry, or even just from the instinct to pull up and tighten our shoulders is simple: cover your neck.</p>
<p><strong>Adjust your diet to the season:</strong> Eating seasonally and locally is a great way to help our bodies stay synchronized with our environment. In spring, with everything in bloom, our bodies can be reactive &#8211; itchy eyes, runny nose, brain fog. While nature is the culprit, it also provides the solution. The flavor associated with spring is sour. Things like citrus, berries, vinegar, tamarind, and greens (all types) can provide us some temporary relief by moving irritants out of our bodies and allowing the liver channel to perform its function. In fact, these foods share the properties of many of the herbal medicines used to help treat spring allergies. Speaking of&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Get ahead of your allergies:</strong> Do spring allergies take you out? Don&#8217;t wait until you are suffering to try and manage the symptoms. Come in early for your treatments and formulas to reduce the severity of your body&#8217;s reaction when the season peaks. As with everything, early intervention will give you the best results.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> The wood element governs the sinews and tendons. The more we nourish ourselves, the less vulnerable we are to injury. Keep your body warm and flexible by staying active and working up a sweat. Feed your body with water, healthy food, and interesting ideas. Get up every hour and stretch your limbs. Check your posture. Do lateral movements and twists that keep the sides of the body open. This is not the time of year for complacency so stretch yourself physically and see if it translates mentally.</p>
<p><strong>Be flexible:</strong> A dry branch will snap under pressure while a healthy one bends with the wind. Attempting to exert too much control of anything will often create more obstacles than taking a step back and rolling with the inevitable ups and downs. In this season in particular, we are asked to be open emotionally, welcoming of new ideas, and willing to go with the flow.</p>
<p>Change is a shake-up, and the transition period can be unnerving. This season let&#8217;s sit with the discomfort, knowing that a shift is coming. Let&#8217;s take the first step, allowing that initial action to inspire us to continue forward. Creating the life we want requires bravery, but we choose the limits to our own potential. Why not make like a tree and reach for the sky?</p>
<p>Spring <em>is</em> coming. Are you ready?</p>

<p>On February 16th we usher in the Chinese New Year and with it the year of the Yang Earth Dog. The vibe of this coming cycle will be more peaceful, calm and stable than the past two years, which for many felt contentious or downright chaotic. This is a good time to take a breath and regroup as tensions begin to soften and an easier, more relaxed energy dominates.</p>
<p>Dogs are practical, honorable and even-tempered. They value logic and truth, and tend to weigh their decisions and make careful choices. While sometimes perceived as stubborn, their diligence, patience, and adherence to rules, helps them to achieve their goals with diplomacy, honesty, and fairness. Dogs are pack animals, putting a spotlight on friendships, relationships, and community. Their reputation for loyalty and faithfulness bodes well for couples and marriage during this time.</p>
<p>This year signals a return to higher principles and seasoned ideals. Reason and justice will dominate, making it a good year for negotiation, arbitration, and compromise. Collaborations and partnerships will flourish and careers have the potential to advance, particularly for those who exhibit altruism and benevolence toward others. Is a good time to pursue new endeavors and plan for the future. Success, however, will be gradual and take resolve due to the more idle energy of this cycle.</p>
<p>Kindness, generosity, and empathy rule in a dog year. People will soften to and be more embracing of others and more willing to open up their social networks. Close friends and family members will spend more time gathering in intimate, comfortable settings. Cooperative movements will rally behind humane pursuits, charities will enjoy more attention, and the &#8220;underdog&#8221; will have his/her day. A global, cultural or societal shake-up is possible, with a focus on better living standards and more social or economic equality.</p>
<p>The earth dog&#8217;s protective, affable energy will give us the space to advance gently in our pursuits with integrity, commitment, and kindness. I wish for all of us to have a prosperous, loving, and peaceful year under the careful watch of our faithful, furry friends!</p>

It reveals you.&#8221; </em><em>&#8211; John Green, The Fault in Our Stars</em></p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine theory, every season has a corresponding spirit. The spirit of the fall is the Po &#8211; our corporeal soul. It is about movement, sensation, and the connection of our bodies to both our minds and to the world at large. It is what gives us animation, reaction, and human emotion. It governs our visceral responses and our capacity for sentiment and empathy.</p>
<p>The emotion associated with fall is grief. In Chinese medicine theory, grief is said to disrupt the flow of our qi, causing us to withdraw and disconnect with the world around us. As I often discuss in face reading sessions, grief is not only about death or the loss of a person. Our face reveals lines my teacher calls &#8220;lost love&#8221; that show up when we let a talent or creative passion lie dormant for too long. The body expresses this loss physically to illuminate the emotional blow felt by the spirit. There is also a collective sorrow that can be felt universally in response to world events that pull at our heartstrings. Regardless of the situation, in periods of emotional mourning we often go inward, retreating into our sadness as we ruminate in solitude waiting for the feelings to pass.</p>
<p>The Po allows us to receive and process our grief, even as our grief transforms us. It is the ability to both be and feel. By connecting us with our human urges, it lets us bring an experience into our being, receive the essential message, and ultimately move forward. It supports personal evolution within a world or space that might appear to have a very disparate agenda. Though we might experience tremendous change as a result of our own journey, the Po allows us to stay grounded in the world in which we reside and navigate the familiar from an internal place that might feel unchartered and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>While on any given day we are capable of all emotions, the seasonal cycle highlights and brings to the forefront those feelings or urges that can be addressed while we are in the strongest position to handle them. I urge you this fall to look at the things that might be causing you grief and harness the power of the season to catalyze your own personal revolution.</p>

<p>Do you always wake at the same time of night or notice energy peaks and dips at certain times of day? In Chinese Medicine theory our body has a daily cycle, dominated in time blocks by each organ system. By observing our energy at these times, we can identify aspects of ourselves that are out of balance and calling for our attention. In the same respect, by aligning our activities with our body&#8217;s natural energy cycle, we can optimize our strengths and perform at our peak. The body clock is broken down as follows:</p>
<p><strong>3-5am &#8211; Lung</strong> &#8211; recipient of vital force; master of order and reduction; controls the rhythm of our existence through the breath. The lung is our connection between the self and outside world and between the body and mind. It helps us discriminate, purify, clear internal clutter, and create space for inspiration. Pathology: grief.</p>
<p><strong>5-7am &#8211; Large Intestine</strong> &#8211; eliminator of waste and turbidity. The large intestine helps us to discern what to keep and what we can discard. By letting go of the unnecessary, it aids the lung by making space for what we truly want and need.</p>
<p><strong>7-9am &#8211; Stomach</strong> &#8211; converter of food to fuel; source of sustenance and care. The stomach receives and ripens our food and fluids and aids the spleen in transforming raw material into nourishment.</p>
<p><strong>9-11am – Spleen</strong> &#8211; processor, transformer, transporter; digestion of food and information; houses intellect, thought, and concentration. The spleen converts and distributes vital energy to our body, provides our mental focus, and allows us to interpret, evaluate and retain information. Pathology: worry, over-thinking.</p>
<p><strong>11am-1pm &#8211; Heart</strong> &#8211; house of our spirit; seat of our consciousness; origin of our capacity for understanding one another. The heart does not force connections or will what it feels &#8211; it acknowledges what is and shines a light on personal truth. All mental distress is mediated through the heart. Pathology: over-excitability, mania.</p>
<p><strong>1pm-3pm &#8211; Small Intestine</strong> &#8211; separator of pure from impure; provider of transparency and lucidity. The small intestine aids the heart by clearing agitation so we may differentiate right from wrong, distinguish relevant from irrelevant, and act with unclouded judgment.</p>
<p><strong>3pm-5pm &#8211; Urinary Bladder</strong> &#8211; filtration and elimination of waste. The urinary bladder aids the kidney in our spiritual evolution by helping us to release harassing thoughts, let go of past traumas, and go with the flow.</p>
<p><strong>5pm-7pm &#8211; Kidney</strong> &#8211; wellspring of life; source of reproduction and growth; foundation of all the body&#8217;s energy from birth to old age. The kidney houses our ability to perceive our personal destiny and our willpower to see it through. It is about what came before us and what we&#8217;ll leave behind. Pathology: fear.</p>
<p><strong>7pm-9pm &#8211; Pericardium</strong> &#8211; protector of the heart; regulator of all the other forces of the body; first line of defense against external aggression. The pericardium receives and buffers disruption to our system, shielding us from emotional turbulence and spiritual unrest.</p>
<p><strong>9pm-11pm &#8211; San Jiao</strong> &#8211; metabolic regulator; responsible for homeostasis, equilibrium and system integration. The san jiao connects all the organ systems of the body, making sure our energy is evenly distributed and we remain oriented and balanced.</p>
<p><strong>11pm-1am &#8211; Gall Bladder</strong> &#8211; promotes good judgment and foresight; responsible for our grit, decisiveness and initiative. The gall bladder allows us to make confident, measured decisions so that we may act with poise, conviction and courage.</p>
<p><strong>1am-3pm &#8211; Liver</strong> &#8211; reservoir of stamina; commander of action, movement, and steady disposition; The liver provides us with a clear vision for the future and the motivation, energy and even temperament to see it through. Pathology: depression, anger.</p>

<p>In Chinese Medicine theory, every season has a corresponding element, spirit, sound, flavor, network of channels, and set of energetic properties. In Spring, the element is Wood, the spirit is Hun (soul), and the energy is action, renewal, metamorphosis, and growth. Spring is the beginning of the new cycle of life, representing hope, creation, and the manifestation of dreams and potential. Just as the world around us is blooming and flowering, we too are called to express the notions of our souls and actualize the inspirations of our hearts.</p>
<p>The element of Wood, deriving from trees, is the symbol of expansion. With deep roots in the earth, it stretches is limbs far and wide, reaching for the sun, bending to the wind, and winding its way around any obstacles that cross its path. It does not strive for perfection. It simply holds steady through the storms and advances, undeterred, toward its highest potential. The self-assured aspect of ourselves, determined to stretch farther and aim higher, is supported by how much of this element we posses. The strength of our own personal Wood element is what gives us the stamina and resilience to create, self-actualize, achieve, and persist.</p>
<p>The Wood element is directly connected to vision &#8211; both literally and metaphorically. When properly nurtured through action, activity and unobstructed expression, our Wood energy provides us with creativity, foresight and clarity. It drives our ambition and provides us with the courage and stamina to implement our wildest ideas and execute our boldest creations. As Henry David Thoreau aptly states, <em>&#8220;In the long run men only hit what they aim for.&#8221;</em> Where will you set your sights this Spring, and how will you harness the energy of the season to bring your visions to life?</p>

Put him in the dark and he&#8217;ll never crow. I have seen the light and I&#8217;m crowing.&#8221; &#8211; Muhammad Ali</em></p>
<p>On January 28th &#8211; the Lunar New Year &#8211; we said goodbye to the capricious unpredictable Yang Fire Monkey and welcomed the more placid and practical Yin Fire Rooster. For many this calmer energy will be a welcome change. Roosters are characterized as organized, practical, decisive, territorial and particular. They posses strong ideals, are honest and critical, and value fidelity, punctuality, and proper behavior. They are leaders, who&#8217;s proud crow at dawn is a daily call to action, tirelessly commanding us to wake up and rise!</p>
<p>Because this is a yin-fire year there is an undercurrent of volatility, though it will not feel as chaotic as last year. Emotions will rise and reactivity will be heightened, but due to the changeability of fire, these bursts will be short-lived. Because there is a yin or feminine aspect to this fire, the change it provokes has the potential to be warm and healing. This symbolic light will help to illuminate unresolved conflict and hidden truths, allowing us to confront the darker aspects of ourselves and grow as a result. If we can fine-tune and articulate our own principles and ideologies while remaining open to others, there is great potential for personal elevation and social transformation.</p>
<p>Personally, this will be year of enhanced intuition, heightened communication, and emotional sentimentality. The flash of the fire element can bring on quick change of emotions, short-lived anger, fear and anxiety. We need to be wise about where we spend our energy and choose our fights with care. On the whole, people will be more warm-hearted, charismatic, and charming and it will be easier to find happiness in simple pleasures. There is an optimistic aspect to the fire element that encourages playfulness and joy. In this coming year, individual prosperity will come in the form of self-realization, group-oriented action, and small, quiet acts of kindness.</p>
<p>Socially, this will be an important year for community. As clashes in values and beliefs come the forefront we will start to see a restructuring of institutions and a shift in thoughts, actions and influence. Chickens are social animals, so during this time people will feel more connected to one other and find comfort in the gathering of like-minded individuals. There will be power in masses and change will come through collaboration and assembling together. Charismatic leaders will emerge and with them a revival of hope and renewal of strength.</p>

<p>In The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, Book 2 Pada 33 states: <em>&#8220;Vitarka Badhane Pratipaksa Bhavnam: When disturbed by negative thoughts, opposite [positive] ones should be thought of. This is pratipaksha bhavana.&#8221;</em> In his discussion of this pada, Sri Swami Satchidananda gives the example of replacing the thought of hate with love. This allows negative thoughts to come to the surface but helps to train us not to ruminate too heavily upon them. He expands on this idea, saying if this is not possible, we can surround ourselves with those we love, in effect helping us to forget the negativity that is burdening the mind. He says we can also attempt to to thwart the negative thought by stopping to think what the ultimate outcome would be if we let it take control.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this principle a lot lately as the quiet of winter sets in and my internal dialogue is amplified. <em>&#8220;Vitarka Badhane Pratipaksa Bhavnam: </em><em>When disturbed by negative thoughts, opposite [positive] ones should be thought </em><em>of. This is pratipaksha bhavana.&#8221;</em> It&#8217;s not as easy as it seems. While we can&#8217;t always invoke the inverse thought to settle the mind, we can at least change our focus to something better. What makes you smile no matter what? I personally can not think about the silly antics of my niece and nephew without grinning ear to ear and chuckling a little to myself. This is not an act of disconnecting from the harder realities, but rather a prioritization of a more valued connection to take me out of a destructive negative spiral. When we invoke feelings of love, others feel our love, causing a cascade of positivity. This not only helps us, but creates a bigger, more global opportunity to uplift those around us. Replacing a negative with a positive &#8211; even if it&#8217;s just in our minds &#8211; is a small step, but one we can strive for every day.</p>

<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mortar-pestle.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-183" alt="mortar-pestle" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mortar-pestle-300x277.jpg" width="300" height="277" srcset="https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mortar-pestle-300x277.jpg 300w, https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mortar-pestle.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><em>&#8220;We are travelers on a cosmic journey, stardust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and whirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. We have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is a precious moment. It is a little parenthesis in eternity.&#8221; &#8211; Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist</em></p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine theory, every season has a corresponding element, whose qualities epitomize both the characteristics of that season and the aspect of our personality that allows us to thrive as we cycle through the earth&#8217;s energetic shifts. As Debra Kaatz so eloquently states in, Characters of Wisdom: Taoist Tales of the Acupuncture Points, &#8220;<em>The element of autumn is metal, the richness that lies within the earth. This is created by what remains of the harvest composting down and enriching the soil with mineral wealth. It also represents the rich gold we have inside that is enriched with the great inspirations of the heavens. Here both taking in and letting go is transformed into earthly gold and inner golden wisdom.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The metal element is aptly represented by the fall season, the time of year where things return to the earth to be repurposed or recreated. There is a shedding of old ideals, beliefs and baggage, and the powerful transformation that comes with the willingness to reduce something down to its purist form. Metal is often equated with alchemy, defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary as <em>1. a medieval chemical science and speculative philosophy aiming to achieve the transmutation of the base metals into gold, the discovery of a universal cure for disease, and the discovery of a means of indefinitely prolonging life; 2. a power or process of transforming something common into something special; 3. an inexplicable or mysterious transmuting.</em> Some of the many powers of metal are its ability to create boundaries, cut away the irrelevant, change shape, and be re-cast into something more purposeful while still retaining its essence. Both the elegance and the magic of metal is its ability to become more valuable and refined through the process of reduction and simplification.</p>
<p>People with a metal constitution tend to be honorable, virtuous, disciplined, and hold themselves to (sometimes impossibly) high standards and values. They appreciate beauty, simplicity, cleanliness, and serenity. A metal person requires minimal sensory input and seeks to clarify truth in its most pure and upright form. They are serious, dignified, and decisive in their actions. While they can often appear as aloof or cold, in fact they are extremely sensitive to nuance and small energetic shifts, particularly to the grief or sorrow of others. Because of their intuitive or empathic nature, they learn to set strong boundaries, and require and enjoy spending time alone in order to rebalance their energy. While their perfectionist nature can sometimes manifest as self-judgment, at their best, metal people will use their idealism and leadership skills to defend virtue and inspire the pursuit of higher standards and truth.</p>
<p>In this powerful season of transformation, it is encouraged that we all take stock of where we are in our journey and separate out what we no longer need to hold, accept, or endure. As we learn from the element of metal, great evolution and mastery can be achieved through reduction. It reminds me of one of my favorite exercises &#8211; for which I can&#8217;t find the original source &#8211; where before we speak we should ask ourselves: &#8220;is it true, is it necessary, is it kind?”. By revisiting our core values, we can reevaluate and repurpose our pursuits, realigning our actions with our heart&#8217;s own truth and living our lives to their fullest potential.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Coming, going, the waterbirds</em><br />
<em> don&#8217;t leave a trace,</em><br />
<em> don&#8217;t follow a path.&#8221;</em><br />
<em> &#8211; Dogen, On Non-Dependence of Mind</em></p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine Theory, Summer is the season of the Heart, of Fire, and of the Spirit. It is a time of illumination and great potential. I love this season because it is tied so deeply to hope and faith, to answering our calling and to reaching our fullest potential. One of my teachers says, &#8220;You only have so many heartbeats. How do you want to use them?&#8221; When we follow a path that aligns with our nature, the answer begins to materialize.</p>
<p>The Heart, in Chinese medicine, is referred to as the Emperor. It is said to house our Shen, or governing spirit, which allows us to understand our true nature and connect deeply with our personal purpose. This is the part of ourselves that is guided by our intuition and revealed by our whims. The heart does not command what it feels or pre-meditate its actions. It keeps us connected to the rhythm of life, able to relate to and communicate with those around us and experience each situation within it&#8217;s own context. When the heart channel is in balance, we feel a peacefulness of spirit, a tranquility of mind, and a clarity to the senses.</p>
<p>When the channel is out of balance we experience anxiety, insomnia, confusion and difficulty concentrating. Any sudden powerful emotional experience will overwhelm the heart, resulting in fright, shock, or emotional instability. We heal our mental suffering through the heart channel by balancing the emotions, calming the Shen and returning to a state of clarity. Allowing our hearts to heal is the only way to heal the spirit, and in doing so, we are better able to heal the whole.</p>
