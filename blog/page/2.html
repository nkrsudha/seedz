<em> &#8211; Thich Nhat Hanh</em></p>
<p>There is a symbiotic relationship between man and nature, both of which can thrive when we choose to live in harmony with the space that we occupy. Eating seasonally and locally is about much more than just being socially and environmentally conscious. The health implications can be quite profound.</p>
<p>In every season the foods that grow in our region have the added bonus of providing us with the taste and temperature properties that help our bodies adjust to the season. The cycle in which plants flower, and fruits and vegetables grow and ripen, corresponds with the changing needs of our bodies from season to season.</p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine theory, Spring is the season of the Liver meridan, who&#8217;s function is strongly associated with nourishment, movement, and the smooth flow of qi. When the channel is out of balance, symptoms such as anger, irritability, muscle aches and pain, stiff joints, spasms, headaches, red itchy eyes, constipation, and feelings of heat or agitation appear.</p>
<p>Foods that help to keep this channel system functioning well tend to be sour in flavor and green in color. Examples include citrus, berries, leeks, leafy greens, and vinegar. Conversely, greasy or spicy foods, alcohol, and amphetamines can have a negative impact on this channel system.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re feeling irritable or stuck, or allergies are stalling your momentum, try this simple but delicious spring recipe to help get your body back on track!</p>
<p>QUINOA SALAD WITH SPRING GREENS &amp; LEMON BASIL DRESSING</p>
<p>Serves: 4-6, Prep Time: 5 min, Cook Time: 30 min, Total Time: 35 minutes</p>
<p>INGREDIENTS:</p>
<p>For the Dressing:</p>
<p>3 tablespoons olive oil<br />
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br />
1 teaspoon honey or agave nectar<br />
1 clove garlic, minced<br />
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh basil<br />
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p>
<p>For the salad:</p>
<p>2 cups water<br />
1 cup quinoa<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
2 teaspoons olive oil<br />
1 small bunch asparagus, about 15 spears, cut into 1-inch pieces<br />
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br />
1 cup sugar snap peas, remove stem and string and cut in halves or thirds (original recipe calls for frozen peas)<br />
2 cups fresh arugula (original recipe calls for 1 avocado, chopped)<br />
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br />
1/4 cup chopped basil</p>
<p>DIRECTIONS:</p>
<p>1. In a small bowl or medium jar, combine the dressing ingredients. Whisk to combine or shake with the jar lid on tight. Set aside.<br />
2. Add water, quinoa, and salt to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 5 minutes. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until water is absorbed. Remove from heat and fluff with a fork.<br />
3. While the quinoa is cooking, cook the asparagus and sugar snap peas. In a large<br />
skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the asparagus, peas, and fresh<br />
lemon juice. Cook until tender, about 5 minutes.<br />
4. In a large bowl, combine quinoa, asparagus, sugar snap peas, and arugula. Pour<br />
the dressing over the salad and stir until well coated. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the fresh basil and serve.</p>

<em>&#8211; Alan W. Watts</em></p>
<p>February 8, 2016 marked the beginning of the year of the Red Fire Monkey. As the explosive nature of the fire element meets the capricious trickery of the monkey, expect a lot of swift change and unpredictable outcomes.</p>
<p>Monkeys are playful and mischievous, full of both creativity and ingenuity. These attributes will come in especially handy in a red, fire year, where challenges can arise rapidly, but also be short-lived. Furthermore, the monkey is a metal element, which can clash with fire, causing conflicts and misunderstandings due to opposing energies. While this energy can feel chaotic or unstable, there is also the potential for profound transformation if we can stay steady in our focus and relinquish some control to the shifting tides.</p>
<p>Like all things disruptive, within the pandemonium lies the potential for wisdom<br />
and prosperity. The more creative and imaginative the endeavor we undertake at this time, the better the chance for unexpected success &#8211; particularly if we remain flexible and are willing to take risks. We might be feeling more impulsive this year, but equally more intuitive and communicative. The fire element will give our spirit and energy a boost, allowing us to laugh more easily at the monkey’s mischievous ways and perhaps take ourselves less seriously.</p>
<p>Energetically, the spring season aligns with the spirit of the fire monkey, a time<br />
for rebirth, growth, expansion, movement, and the re-awakening of the life process.<br />
It is the time of year to stretch our limbs, and our minds, and seek emotional equanimity by letting the qi flow freely and uninhibited. While the energy of the season puts us in a position to assert our ambition, it also provides us with the clarity of judgment to know when to let go. The better we modulate our intensity and stay flexible, the smoother the flow of liver qi. The smoother the flow of liver qi, the better we can handle whatever curve ball the monkey throws our way.</p>
<p>Since these rapid fluctuations can leave us feeling a bit scattered or anxious, we will be tested over this year in our ability to yield and greet each new wave with a sense of humor and a willingness to be patient and see where it takes us. Since Spring, as the Huang Di Nei Jing describes it, is a time when &#8220;the energy should be kept open and fluid,&#8221; by bending to the season, we are also better equipped to handle the greater cosmic challenges that cross our paths at the hands of that cheeky monkey.</p>

<p><em>Fate whispers to the warrior</em><br />
<em> &#8220;You cannot withstand the storm&#8221;</em><br />
<em> and the warrior whispers back</em><br />
<em> &#8220;I am the storm&#8221;                                                          &#8211; Author Unknown</em></p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine Theory, every season/channel/element is connected with a spirit. The spirit of the Kidney channel is called the <em>zhi.</em>  As outlined in the Huang di Nei Jing, &#8220;The Spirit of the Kidneys, the zhi, rules the will, desire, ambition, and survival instinct.&#8221;</p>
<p>As with everything, there is a yin and yang aspect to our <em>zhi</em>. The yang component is the more active side, representing effort, determination, and willpower. It is the motivational facet of our ambition &#8211; the putting forth of effort to bring us to our goals. When our kidney yang is weak, it leaves us passive and unassertive. When it is overactive or forced, we easily burn out or deplete ourselves.</p>
<p>The yin aspect to our <em>zhi</em> represents something deeper inside of us. It is a persistent, unconscious drive that guides our choices on a more spiritual level, aligned with our higher purpose or fate.  It is that little voice inside coaxing us gently in the right direction as it advocates for our inner truth. This more intangible part of our will is best accessed during self-reflection and meditation &#8211; activities encouraged during the winter season. When our kidney yin is weak, it causes a disturbance in this aspect of our spirit, inducing agitation, discontent, fear, and the inability to act.</p>
<p>When we can connect the yin and yang, focusing our efforts on answering to our true calling, our spirit is at peace. This requires the discipline to discover who we are at our core and the bravery to act congruently. By letting our instincts guide us, we can begin to align our actions with our inner awareness, bringing us closer to achieving our highest potential and living a more purposeful, fulfilling life.</p>

<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lotus-light.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-137" alt="lotus light" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lotus-light-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lotus-light-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lotus-light.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>As we say goodbye to 2015 and usher in the new year, we are presented with an opportunity to reflect on the past and evaluate how we&#8217;d like to move forward in the future. While many of us approach the new year with optimism, quite often as the minutia of our day-to-day lives takes over, we lose focus of our resolutions, falling back into old, comfortable patterns.</p>
<p>In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (Book 1, Pada 28), he discusses mantrum, &#8220;that which keeps the mind steady and produces the proper effect.&#8221; The idea is that constant repetition, or japa, of one specific word/goal/desire/action will create a habit, until eventually we &#8220;imbibe the qualities&#8221; of the thing we repeat.</p>
<p>Pada 32 reads, <i>Tat Pratisedhartham Eka Tattva Bhyasah, </i>&#8220;The practice of concentration on a single subject [or the use of one technique] is the best way to prevent the obstacles and their accompaniments.&#8221; In his discussion of this Pada, Sri Swami Satchidananda enforces that we must keep digging, or working at our goal, even if we encounter obstacles. Steadying the mind on the single object of our attention allows us to give it our full focus and power. This is not to say  obsess, but to stay on one track, so the bigger meaning and ultimate transformation can be revealed.</p>
<p>The idea that concentration is a practice rings very true for me. It requires that we are deliberate in our efforts. To simplify does not necessarily mean or goal is simple, but rather it is pure and undisrupted by distraction, fear and doubt.</p>
<p>He sums it up beautifully saying, &#8220;Stick to one thing and forge ahead with that. Why do you want to have this one-pointed concentration? To make the mind clear so you can transcend it. You are not going to cling to the object but just use it as a ladder to climb up. Once you have reached the roof you leave the ladder behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>So in thinking of New Years resolutions, perhaps this year we can all choose to focus on one thing that is really tugging at our hearts, and let this year be a practice in concentration on our ability to see it through.</p>

<p><em><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fall-leaf-on-ground.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-122" alt="fall leaf on ground" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fall-leaf-on-ground-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fall-leaf-on-ground-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fall-leaf-on-ground.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>“The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.” – Socrates</em></p>
<p>I love the ritual of acknowledging an ending and embracing a new beginning and I find myself to be particularly reflective this time of year. Fall is a time for letting go of things that are no longer of value to us, so we can descend toward the earth for our winter slumber with a clear mind and heart, ready to receive nourishment, fresh vision, and new wisdom.</p>
<p>Just as the trees are shedding their leaves and animals are going underground and preparing their nests, fall represents for us a chance to return to the source and do an inward inventory of what we need to release in order to move forward. While outwardly things appear to be in a state of decline, it is just an old skin being shed, relieving us of the past so we can clean house internally and move in a direction that supports the needs of our spirit.</p>
<p>This year, the autumn equinox fell on the same day as Yom Kippur, a day to atone for the past and start anew. As I sat in reflection, I realized the major incidents that repeatedly came to my mind, were things from way back in my past. Had I truly not forgiven myself?</p>
<p>In TCM theory, every channel has a corresponding emotion. The emotion associated with fall and the lung channel is grief, a state that requires acceptance of what is and the fluidity to move through it. Held for too long, it can leave us cold and detached, interrupting the flow of our qi and blocking its ability to facilitate transformation.</p>
<p>With the change in season comes a new opportunity for clarity, prompting us to shed the past and simplify as we move toward the future. Just like metal, the element that so aptly represents the season, we can find power in reduction. The focus of my meditation this fall will be forgiveness. What will you let go of to make your nest clutter-free?</p>

<p><em>“The doctor of the future will give no medication, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.”  &#8211; Thomas Edison</em></p>
<p>The earth is our most abundant pharmacy, providing us exactly what we need in any given time of year to stay healthy and strong. When we eat seasonally and locally, the foods we are ingesting contain the properties we need to stay well all year long. Fall is the season of dryness and the more abruptly it comes on, the quicker our bodies need to adapt. If you’re feeling a bit parched, try these simple dietary solutions to reconcile these common fall imbalances:</p>
<p><strong>Allergies, Sore Throat, Cough</strong><br />
As the leaves begin to change color and fall from the trees, they become brittle and crumble to dust. When we inhale this particle dust it can cause allergies, cough, sore throat, and inflammation. In TCM theory, our lung channel regulates the qi for the entire body. Foods that are more acrid or pungent aid the lungs in keeping the qi circulating and dispersing. If you’re feeling a tickle in your throat, try apples, pears, miso soup with scallion, cabbage, leeks, onion, garlic and ginger. If the qi is rebelling in the form of a cough, root vegetables help to pull energy downward. If the throat feels raw, tea with ginger or ginseng and honey is not only soothing, but can give you a powerful immune boost. If allergies persist, herbal formulas are a great solution to get them under control.</p>
<p><strong>Dry, Itchy Skin</strong><br />
The moisture from the summer has left the air leaving it cool, crisp and static. To protect our skin from drying out while it works to protect us from the elements, we need to do more to nourish it from the inside out. In addition to the lung-qi boosting suggestions above, the simplest way to keep your skin healthy and glowing is to stay hydrated. Water, water, water, is great in any season. Also, don’t skimp on the Omega 3’s (healthy fats) such as those found in avocados, egg yolks, and olive oil. Oily seeds such as flax and sesame also help to keep the skin and entire body moistened (grind them to maximize the benefits) and sesame and coconut oil are widely used topically to protect the skin and keep it supple.</p>
<p><strong>Constipation</strong><br />
In the seasonal transition when the weather is erratic and windy, the body becomes more vulnerable as it works to adjust to the change. Fall dryness can reach beyond the skin and lungs, moving deeper into the body and causing sluggish digestion or constipation. In addition to staying hydrated, oily nuts and seeds (in reasonable quantities) such as almonds or walnuts can help to lubricate the intestines and keep things flowing smoothly. Mineral rich vegetables from the earth also help to support metal – the element of fall. Things like pumpkin, yams, squash, bananas, walnuts, and beets help to keep our digestion regular and keep our belly’s happy and nourished. Also, chew slowly so you know when you’re full, and eat while relaxed to aid digestion and promote nutrient absorption.</p>
<p><strong>A Deliciously Simple Fall Recipe</strong><br />
Try this seasonal recipe from one of my favorite cookbooks, <em>Ancient Wisdom, Modern Kitchen</em> to keep the lungs strong, the throat relaxed, the fluids ample, and the tummy happy:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ginger-Honey Pear</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Ingredients</em><br />
2 medium-size pears, peeled<br />
2 tablespoons honey<br />
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger<br />
3 tablespoons water</p>
<p><em>Directions</em><br />
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.<br />
2. Cut off the top third of each pear and reserve. Cut out the core of the bottom part of the pear, making a hole but leaving the bottom and outside intact. Place the pears and the tops on a glass or ceramic dish.<br />
3. In a small bowl, combine the honey, ginger, and water. (Heat the mixture to encourage the honey to dissolve, if necessary.)<br />
4. Place the ginger mixture inside the pears. Now replace the top on each pear, restoring its original shape, and brush the sauce on the outside of the pear as well. Save 2 teaspoons or so of the sauce for later.<br />
5. Bake the pears for 10 to 12 minutes, until they have begun to soften.<br />
6. Take the pears out of the oven for a moment and drizzle with the remaining sauce, then return the pears to the oven and broil at a high setting for 3 to 5 minutes, until the glaze has caramelized. Serve warm.</p>

<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mint-water.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-115" alt="mint water" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mint-water-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" srcset="https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mint-water-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mint-water.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Summer has arrived and the heat is on! As with every season, the earth has provided us with a plethora of foods to help us keep cool in the warm months to come. Foods that are available this season naturally contain the properties our bodies need to stay cool and hydrated during the warm months of summer.</p>
<p>Follow these seasonal diet tips to keep your cool when the weather is hot.</p>
<p><strong>1. Clear Heat: Watermelon</strong> – It is no coincidence that watermelon is a staple of the summer. For those days when you’ve gotten a little too much sun, watermelon helps to clear heat, replenish fluids, and quench thirst. The rind can also be used to reduce swelling from summer heat.</p>
<p><strong>2. Stay Cool: Mint</strong> – In most hot regions, you will notice that mint tea is consumed regularly. Cool and acrid, mint helps to disperse heat and cool the body down – particularly the head. Steeped in tea, mixed into your favorite dishes, or added to salads for a refreshing pop of flavor, mind is a great herb to incorporate into your diet this summer.</p>
<p><strong>3. Hydrate: Coconut Water</strong> – There is no part of the coconut I do not love. I’ve even seen the shell used as a bowl – the perfect food! Coconut water is high in potassium and contains natural electrolytes, helping to keep you hydrated. And it’s healthier than your average sports drink. So on the hot days to come, try rotating in some coconut water with your daily water intake.</p>
<p><strong>4. Want a treat?</strong> – Throw 1-3 in a blender for a refreshing summer beverage! Or freeze into popsicles. Endless possibilities…</p>
<p><strong>5. Hot &amp; Sluggish? Go Bitter</strong> – Foods that are bitter tend to drain and purge, reducing water retention and clearing heat on those hot sticky days. They have the added bonus of reducing anxiety, decreasing agitation, and promoting good sleep. Some examples include: artichoke, asparagus, celery, chicory, dandelion leaf/tea, kale, watercress, rhubarb, oregano, parsley, sage, thyme, and turmeric.</p>
<p><strong>6. Prevent Fluid Loss: Eat Sour</strong> – Foods that taste sour have the ability to stabilize and bind, preventing the loss of too much fluid and keeping a harmonious flow to the body. They are also a great go-to if you are feeling stressed or irritable. Some examples include: leeks, tomato, apple, apricots, citrus, berries, grapes, kiwi, plum, pomegranate, coriander, vinegar, and raspberry tea.</p>
<p>With these simple dietary modifications you can beat the heat and have a happy healthy summer!</p>

As we wait in anticipation for the buds to bloom and the earth to become lush and vibrant, some of us are also faced with the prospect of spring allergies. Red watery eyes, itchy throat, runny nose, coughing, sneezing, and sinus pressure are just some of the possible symptoms that can inhibit our enjoyment of the warmer weather. Right now we are at a crucial point in the season to intercept allergy symptoms before they begin. The following strategies can help:</p>
<p><strong>Acupuncture:</strong> In a feature article on Web MD reviewing natural strategies for the treatment of allergies, Colette Bouchez writes, “In a small but significant study of 26 hay fever patients published in the American Journal of Chinese Medicine, acupuncture reduced symptoms in all 26 &#8212; without side effects. A second study of some 72 people totally eliminated symptoms in more than half, with just two treatments. “ (See full article at <a title="http://www.webmd.com/allergies/features/relieve-allergies-natural-way" href="http://www.webmd.com/allergies/features/relieve-allergies-natural-way">http://www.webmd.com/allergies/features/relieve-allergies-natural-way</a>)</p>
<p>What distinguishes acupuncture from other traditional allergy treatments is that it is geared toward boosting the immune system to enable our bodies to fight external allergens. Each treatment is customized to the patient based on the individual presentation and therefore really targets the root of what’s causing the reaction. For best results, begin treatments before any major symptoms appear.</p>
<p><strong>Herbal Medicine</strong>: Many traditional allergy medications, while temporarily effective, also come with an array of side effects. One of the many benefits of Chinese herbal medicine is that formulas are virtually side effect free. Customizable formulas are chosen based on the distinct pattern that a patient is showing so as to specifically address an imbalance in the system. Since the formulas are designed to target the root of what is <em>causing</em> the symptom, rather than the symptom itself, they do not usually need to be taken long-term.</p>
<p><strong>Diet:</strong> When it comes to seasonal allergies, simple dietary adjustments can be quite effective. Foods that help promote the smooth functioning of the Liver/Gallbladder channel systems (which are dominant this time of year) often help reduce spring allergy symptoms. These foods tend to be sour in flavor and green in color. Some examples include bok choy, green apple, apricot, berries, citrus fruits, kiwi, plums, pineapple, dandelion, and vinegar. Alcohol and greasy or spicy foods should be limited and if there is a lot of phlegm or congestion, reduce the consumption of sugar and dairy.</p>
<p><strong>Movement:</strong> Based on what we see happening around us in nature, it is not surprising that during the spring our bodies crave movement. This is the time of year to increase activity, stretch our limbs, and keep energy circulating. Specific types of movements to target the channels dominant in the spring include lateral stretches that open up the side body and neck, exercises that involve hip rotation, and strengthening and stretching of the inner and outer thighs and shins.</p>
<p>Don’t let allergies put a damper on your spring! By being proactive you can seriously reduce the effects of external allergens on your body and enjoy the beauty of the season.</p>

<p>The Chinese/Lunar New Year begins on February 19, 2015 on the second new moon after the winter solstice. With each Lunar New Year comes a new cycle of dominant elements and animal energy, and with it a shift in our focus, actions and inclinations. This year we will be closing out the year of the Yang Wood Horse, abundant with action and speedy execution, and welcoming the more tranquil energy of the Yin Wood Sheep (also referred to as goat or ram).</p>
<p>While the Wood element remains prominent, enriching our ability to grow, be inspired and evolve, we shift from Yang to Yin, inviting us to turn it inward and be more deliberate with our actions, clear with our thoughts, and true to our values. By nurturing our creative, intuitive, and emotional selves, we can better perpetuate outer harmony, peaceful relationships, and serve the good of the whole.</p>
<p>The Sheep &#8211; sympathetic, gentle and kind &#8211; is considered the most feminine of the zodiac animals. Generous, intuitive and patient, the Sheep is a healer, encouraging us to embrace our nature, forgive ourselves for the past, nurture our desires, and work toward positive growth. We are in a great position to improve our quality of life during this time.</p>
<p>As flock animals, sheep are community minded. Teamwork, collaboration, charity, and human connection will be markers for success this year. On a personal level, home, family and social gatherings move to the forefront. More globally, there is a shift toward spirituality, tolerance, reconciliation, and humanitarian efforts.</p>
<p>Let’s embrace the energy of the next year by slowing down, looking inward, and taking care of our selves and of one another!</p>

<p><em>“The lung is the source of inspiration &#8211; it creates the open space, the emptiness within which new ideas and emotions take shape.” &#8211; Harriet Beinfield &amp; Efram Korngold, Between Heaven and Earth</em></p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fall-forest.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-87" alt="fall forest" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fall-forest-300x208.jpg" width="300" height="208" srcset="https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fall-forest-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fall-forest.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Lung organ system governs the reception, movement, and expiration of qi, the circulating force behind the entire function of our bodies. Through the inhale we bring in the pure qi and release the impure through the exhale. This involuntary, repetitive action acts both as a cleansing process and a means of establishing the rhythm by which the body flows. The Lung’s yang partner, the Large Intestine, aids the process by evaluating what nutrients are of value to the body, and what can be eliminated.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This process of discernment, purification, and release has both physical and emotional implications. When the Lung qi is weak, we are most susceptible to sadness or grief, however, grief consumes the lung qi, creating a cyclical pattern of emotional injury. When the lung qi is strong, every new inhale contains boundless possibility and every exhale is an opportunity to release and move on from the past. Every cycle of inspiration, dissemination, and expiration allows us the opportunity to escape from the limitations of our thoughts and to truly exist in the moment.</p>
<p>To honor the spirit of the season, I offer you this simple, breath-based meditation.</p>
<p><strong>The Set-Up</strong></p>
<p>To begin your practice, lie down on your back with a rolled up blanket or bolster underneath your knees. Let the legs roll to a position where they feel comfortable. If the neck is uncomfortable or the chin is jutting toward the ceiling, place an additional folded blanked underneath your head.</p>
<p>Rotate the arms so that the palms and inner arms are facing the ceiling and the chest feels broad and open. If the shoulders are hunched away from the floor, draw each shoulder blade slightly inward and downward until you feel the chest broaden.</p>
<p><strong>The Practice</strong></p>
<p>Once the body is comfortable, take one hand to the chest, one hand to the belly. Close the eyes softly. Relax the facial muscles completely. Let the bones feel heavy against the floor. Let the muscles soften around the bones. Feel the rise and fall of the chest and abdomen as you breath in and out.</p>
<p>Observe the rhythm of the breath and where it is moving. Notice when you inhale if you tend to fill the chest, or the belly, or both. Notice when you exhale where you deflate. Notice the thoughts as they wander in. With the breath as your template &#8211; momentary and impermanent &#8211; see if you can invite the thoughts to pass through just as fluidly as they enter.</p>
<p>Start to deliberately slow the breath down, making each inhale and each exhale as soft and long and smooth as you can. Try to match the length of the inhale and exhale, never gasping for breath, but letting the flow be even and steady.</p>
<p>Start to move the breath with more intention. Filling up completely, breath in through the nose, down into the chest, then the upper belly, the mid-belly, the low belly, all the way down to pelvic floor. Exhale just as deliberately, emptying first the low belly, then the mid-belly, the upper belly, the chest, and all the way out the mouth. Every inhale a rebound of the exhale. Every exhale a rebound of the inhale.</p>
<p>Imagine something you would like to create more space for in your life. Simple, genuine, true. When you inhale, imagine how it will feel when this desire begins to manifest. Invite that sensation in, in through the nose, the chest, the upper belly, mid-belly, low belly, all the way down to the pelvic floor.</p>
<p>Choose something you’ve been holding on to that is no longer relevant to your present. When you exhale, release it out through the low belly, mid-belly, upper belly, chest, and throat.</p>
<p>Create a word, or mantra, for the thing you wish to bring in and the thing you wish to release. Repeat these words in your mind with each inhale and each exhale, opening up to the future by releasing the past.</p>
<p>Stay with the technique for as long as you are comfortable. When you feel ready, let the breath fall back into it’s natural rhythm. Feel the body completely relaxed, light with possibility, unencumbered by the mundane. Be with this feeling.</p>
<p><strong>The Exit</strong></p>
<p>Start to deepen the breath, reconnecting with your physical body. Notice the weight of your bones. Notice your fingers and your toes. Notice sensation on the skin.</p>
<p>Stretch the arms up and overhead and take a full body stretch like you are just waking up to a brand new day. Bend the knees and roll gently over on to your right hand side. Pause. Then press yourself up to sit.</p>
<p>Join the palms together at the center of the chest. Touch your thumbs to your sternum, tapping into that inner oasis of quiet, simplicity, and clarity. Then bow your chin to your chest, bowing toward the wisdom of your intuition, your heart’s voice, your wise advisor with all the right answers to all of your most important questions. The farthest we ever need to look is within.</p>
<p>Namaste.</p>
