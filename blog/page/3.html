The pungent taste invigorates the lungs and opens the pores.” &#8211; The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Medicine</em></p>
<p>As we enter the Fall season, the bright uplifting energy of summer begins to descend. We see leaves drying up and falling to the earth to be reintegrated into the soil. Animals begin to gather and bury food, preparing for the cold months ahead. As things in nature start to burrow into the ground and the cooling foods of summer are replaced by the hearty root vegetables of the earth, we’re prompted to shift our diets to prepare our bodies to store and insulate for the cooler months to come.</p>
<p>In Chinese medicine theory, fall is the season of the Lung, it’s corresponding element Metal, and it’s yang partner the Large Intestine. The main functions of this organ system are to move healthy qi through the body, protect us from externally contracted disease, eject any invading illness before it worsens, and separate the pure from the impure. Foods that are pungent in flavor, and often white in color, are invigorating and have the ability to disperse, thereby assisting these channels with their tasks. When we choose foods that support the organ system that is dominant in the season, we better support the smooth functioning of our body as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting the Lung System/Metal Element</strong></p>
<p>Within each organ system there are specific vulnerabilities, manifesting as symptoms when there is disharmony in the channels. Some dietary strategies to handle common imbalances of the Lung system are outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>Dryness:</strong> In general, the fall is a dry time of year. As leaves and plants begin to dry up and turn to dust, we inevitably absorb some of this into our own bodies, creating anything from mild irritation, to full blown allergies. As our body’s first line of defense, the Lung system has a natural aversion to dryness and is the channel most deeply affected by it. Some ways that dryness might manifest in the body is dry sneezes, itchy skin, brittle hair, nosebleeds, or dry throat with cough. Some foods to help counteract dryness and support the Lung’s ability to protect the body include: pear, apple, walnuts, eggs, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, leeks, onion, mustard leaf, chive, garlic, and ginger.</p>
<p><strong>Cold:</strong> In the transition months, when the weather can be drastically different from day to day, we are more vulnerable to common colds. It often begins with that first prickle of chills at the back of the neck on a windy day (wear a scarf!), and without proper care can progress into something more. Symptoms of a cold invasion include: chills, head and body aches, coughing, sneezing, and runny nose. Foods to help move the cold out more quickly and prevent it from turning into something worse include: soups, broths, porridges, stews, ginger, garlic, onion, cayenne, chili powder, cinnamon, clove, chive, fennel seed, horseradish, winter squash, lamb or mutton.</p>
<p><strong>Heat</strong>: If a common cold lingers in the body too long, it begins to burrow deeper causing more severe flu-like symptoms that often manifest as heat. Some common symptoms include: fever, chills, perspiration, sore throat, cough, wheezing, thirst, constipation, and asthmatic breathing. Foods to help clear the heat include: apple, pear, persimmon, mango, celery, carrot, mushroom, asparagus, pumpkin, radish, bamboo shoots, cabbage, nori, and octopus.</p>
<p><strong>Phlegm:</strong> Fall allergies, colds, and flus are often accompanied by an abundance of phlegm, congestion, and sinus pressure. Other common symptoms include: mental fogginess, chest tightness/distention, coughing, sneezing, copious mucus, and difficulty breathing. Foods to help break up phlegm include: garlic, ginger, onion, scallion, mustard/mustard greens, fennel seed, rosemary, sage, radish, seaweed, winter squash, shitake mushrooms, turnip, watercress, pear, papaya, and persimmon. Avoid foods like milk, dairy, soy, and sugar when there is a lot of mucus present.</p>
<p><strong>Water Retention:</strong> The combination of erratic weather and the need to fight off attacks from external germs and allergens, can overtax the Lung system. If the qi is weak, dispersion of fluids can become compromised. This can manifest as: edema, scanty urination, shortness of breath, or chest fullness. Foods to help strengthen the lung qi and re-balance the system include: garlic, ginger, honey, barley/barley malt, rye, mustard/dandelion greens, mango, pineapple, papaya, celery, carrots, pumpkin, artichoke, asparagus, bamboo shoots, bok choy, nori, aduki beans, kidney beans, mackerel, and sardines.</p>
<p><strong>Fatigue:</strong> As the days get shorter and sunshine is less abundant, it is challenging to continue to move at the pace of summer. When the body is forced to fight the rhythm of nature, the extra effort that is required can take a toll. Some common symptoms include recurring colds, weak voice, low spirit, lack of desire to communicate, sadness, or grief. Foods that can help keep us preserve the energy we have and generate the additional energy we need include: apples, pears, chicken broth, walnuts, eggs, yams, oats, artichoke, carrots, onion, radish, sweet potato, yam, mango, orange, plum, licorice, sage, thyme, honey, sesame seed, octopus, oyster, and sardines.</p>
<p><strong>Supporting the Lung System’s Partner Organs/Elements</strong></p>
<p>Chinese medicine treats the body holistically, viewing the channels, organs, and elements as one big integrated system working for the good of the whole. Although seasonal nuance affects our bodies in general, we all have specific patterns of imbalance that tend to arise when external factors or stresses provoke our constitutional vulnerabilities. By better understanding the checks and balances of the system, we can fine tune our diets to our bodies more specifically to support the smooth function of the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Earth/Metal:</strong> In five element theory, Earth (Spleen) generates Metal (Lung). If Earth is too weak to provide the nutrients to create Metal, Metal will be weak. Concurrently, if Metal is pulling too much from Earth, Earth will become weak. This tends to manifest as excessive phlegm or mucus, digestive issues, and emotional worry or over-thinking. To support the Spleen channel/Earth element, introduce flavors that are mildly sweet (think oats &#8211; not sugar) or yellow in color, such as healthy fruits and grains, to help keep this relationship strong. Some foods that concurrently support the Lung and Spleen channels include: asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, capers, daikon, leeks, parsnip, bell pepper, radish, basil, cardamom, cinnamon, fennel, garlic, ginger, rosemary, saffron, jasmine, and peppermint.</p>
<p><strong>Metal/Water:</strong> In five element theory, Metal (Lung) generates Water (Kidney), If Water pulls too much fluid from Metal, Metal will be weak. Their connection is strongly related to fluid metabolism. When there relationship is out of balance it can result in symptoms of dryness, counterflow (cough/asthma), fluid accumulation (edema), or emotional sadness or fear. To support the Kidney channel/Water element, introduce flavors that are salty, such as seaweed or shellfish. Some foods that concurrently support the Lung and Kidney include spices such as chive, garlic, and parsley.</p>
<p><strong>Fire/Metal:</strong> In five element theory the Fire element (Heart) controls the Metal element (Lung). If Fire over-controls Metal, the lung qi will be weak. If Metal rebels against Fire, it will effect the heart causing a disturbance of spirit. This often manifests as anxiety, dream disturbed sleep, hot flashes, or mouth/tongue sores. To support the Heart channel/Fire element, add bitter foods such as green tea, asparagus, dandelion leaf and rhubarb, to drain some of the heat generated by overabundant fire or red foods like strawberries to calm the spirit. Some foods that concurrently support the Lung and Heart include: asparagus, broccoli, capers, scallion, turnip, watercress, basil, cardamom, marjoram, oregano, parsley, sage, thyme, and turmeric.</p>
<p><strong>Metal/Wood:</strong> In five element theory, the Metal element (Lung) controls the Wood element (Liver). If Metal overacts on Wood the liver qi does not flow smoothly, causing symptoms such as menstrual irregularity or pain, headaches, depression irritability, or anger. If wood rebels against metal, it can cause respiratory issues or breathlessness. To support the Liver channel/Wood element, incorporate foods that are sour in flavor or green in color such as citrus fruit, green apple, berries, and leafy greens. Some foods that concurrently support the Lung and Liver include leeks, juniper, and lemon balm.</p>
<p>Understanding how different flavors of food affect the body provides us with an abundance of tools to protect our health and support longevity. I encourage you to incorporate some of the suggestions above to address any symptoms you are feeling and take note of the effects. Have a happy, healthy Fall!</p>

<p>One of the most anticipated seasonal transitions is winter to spring. After a long period of hibernation and reflection, our bodies are primed and ready for movement and active expression. As the days get progressively longer and incrementally warmer, our spirit, much like the buds starting to form on the trees, is longing to burst forth and bloom. While these erratic transitional weeks can feel restraining, by employing these simple steps we can handle the fluctuations with grace and enter into the next phase of nature’s cycle with ease.</p>
<p><b>1. Get Up and Go!</b> – Spring is the season of the Liver channel and it’s corresponding element of Wood. It is a time of rebirth, reawakening, growth and expansion – a metamorphosis best realized through action. To keep joints healthy and muscles and tendons supple, we are encouraged to create heat in the body and extend our limbs. So open up and stretch toward the sun, raise your heart rate, explore deep twists and side bends, tap into your creativity and give physical expression to your ambitions!</p>
<p><b>2. Get Ahead of your Allergies</b> – While seasonal allergies can put a serious damper on our enjoyment of the warmer weather, don’t fear the impending pollen! Herbal medicine combined with regular acupuncture can get you through the season virtually symptom free. For best results, start treatments <i>before</i> your symptoms appear. If you do suffer from seasonal allergies some good foods to incorporate into your diet include ginger, onions, garlic, bamboo shoots, cabbage, beets, carrots, leafy greens and yams. Some foods to avoid are wheat, citrus, chocolate, shellfish, dairy and potatoes.</p>
<p><b>3. Eat for the Season</b> – Anyone who’s had a treatment from me has had the discussion about why it’s important to eat locally and seasonally. Foods that are available in your region at any given point in time tend to contain the temperature properties that your body needs in that season. To stay balanced in the spring, it is good to start introducing sour foods back into your diet. This includes things like lemon, vinegar, berries, apricots, grapefruit, kiwi, tamarind and coriander. The liver also benefits from natural detoxifiers such as spinach, dandelion, green apple and kale. If you’re feeling tense, avoid alcohol and greasy or spicy foods.</p>
<p><b>4. Stabilize the Emotions</b> – In TCM theory, the Liver channel is responsible for the unencumbered flow of emotion.  When liver qi stagnates it can cause emotional depression or a feeling of tension. If left unchecked, it can lead to anger, irritability, or rage and inhibit our judgment and ability to make sound decisions. In this period of expression, let no obstacle block you from the fulfillment of your desire. Relieve tension in the way your body responds best, avoid external stressors, and use the momentum of the season to execute the plans that most excite you.</p>
<p><b>5. Cover Your Neck</b> &#8211; I always administer this piece of advice in the spring and fall. Spring is the season of wind and when the wind enters the body it can manifest as tremors, dizziness, muscle spasms, stiff neck and headaches. The easiest way to protect yourself is cover your neck. With drastic temperature swings from day to day, it’s hard to choose your outerwear, so keep your neck protected by wearing a scarf.</p>

<p>As more people seek natural healthcare alternatives, ancient therapies are making their way into the mainstream. Cupping, used frequently by acupuncturists to enhance their treatments, is one such therapy.  You might notice circular bruises peaking out of people’s tank tops or on display in a backless dress, raising the question of what exactly is cupping therapy and what does it treat?</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_66699187.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-57" alt="shutterstock_66699187" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_66699187-300x205.jpg" width="300" height="205" srcset="https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_66699187-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_66699187.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Cupping is a method of treatment where de-oxygenated cups are applied to the skin, creating a vacuum, so that suction can be applied to strategic areas of the body. This suction helps to break up congestion or stagnation in the body, helping muscles to relax, fascia to release, phlegm to disperse, pain and swelling to diminish, and qi and blood to flow more freely through the channels.</p>
<p>Some common uses for cupping include:</p>
<p><b>Colds and Flu:</b> Cupping is used to, break up mucus, ease coughs, address neck stiffness and chills, and disperse any lingering pathogens in the body allowing faster recovery and decreasing the risk of relapse.</p>
<p><b>Allergies, Asthma and Bronchitis:</b> Cupping is used to address many disorders involving the lungs by unblocking the chest, decreasing accumulation of phlegm, and removing blockages that inhibit smooth breathing.</p>
<p><b>Musculoskeletal and Arthritic Pain:</b>  Cupping helps to warm stiff muscles, address pain from traumatic injury and promote healing, reduce swelling and inflammation, and relieve pain and stiffness associated with arthritis.</p>
<p><b>Menstrual Irregularities and Discomfort:</b> Irregular menstruation, painful periods, PMDD, and PMS can range from temporarily debilitating to downright disruptive. Cupping is used frequently to address common menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and symptoms of cramping, pain and headaches that frequently accompany a women’s monthly cycle.</p>
<p><b>GI Disorders:</b> Healthy digestion is fundamental to the overall health of our bodies. Cupping can be used in conjunction with your acupuncture treatments to address a range of gastro-intestinal disorders including abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, stomachaches, and indigestion.</p>
<p><b>Skin Disorders:</b>  More and more people are turning to Chinese medicine to address skin disorders that are complicated to treat. Cupping therapy, often in combination with herbal therapy, can be used in the treatment of challenging skin disorders including acne, eczema, and psoriasis.</p>
<p>Short of some temporary bruising, the risks from cupping therapy are minimal and the rewards can be great. With such a versatile range of benefits, cupping is a valuable adjunct therapy to your acupuncture treatments.</p>

<p>Curious about acupuncture but not sure how it might benefit you?  Here are three great reasons to give it a try:</p>
<p><b>1. Stress: </b>When it comes to our health, we all have our own set of unique vulnerabilities to which we are predisposed. When extenuating circumstances, or even just the hectic pace of our lives become overwhelming, the stress we are absorbing will oftentrigger a series of undesirable symptoms or cause long-term disease to flare up. Acupuncture helps to remove unwanted tension and promote a smooth flow of energy, so that stress does not have the chance to build up in the body and cause our natural physiological processes to slow down or malfunction.  It also elicits a deep relaxation response, allowing us to repair while the body rests.</p>
<p><b>2. Sleep: </b>Sleep is one of the most vital keys to good health and vitality and eight hours is the recommended length of sleep per night.  How much sleep are you getting?  And what is the quality?  Do you feel rested when you wake up? By getting to the root of what is disturbing your sleep, acupuncture and herbal medicine can be used to improve both the quantity, and more importantly the quality of your sleep, ultimately resulting in an overall improvement of energy, mental acuity, and health throughout the day.</p>
<p><b>3. Digestion: </b>What’s happening with your digestion is indicative of your body’s overall ability to function smoothly. Constipation, diarrhea, reflux, gas, bloating, and cramping are all symptoms alerting us to a deeper imbalance occurring in the body.  By looking to the cause, rather than just the symptoms, acupuncture, dietary awareness, and herbal medicine are excellent natural tools to improve digestion, thereby supporting smooth bodily function and improving our overall health and wellbeing.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Reason #4:</b> Mention this post when you schedule your next appointment and get $10 off.</p>

<p>Those of you who have been with me since the start might have noticed there has been a “blog” page on my website for quite some time now. Admittedly, I’ve been dragging my feet. But no more excuses! I have decided to embrace the fear (mostly of technology) and move forward, and as luck would have it, I have the aid of a bright new energy that’s just been unleashed. This Lunar New Year ushers in the year of the horse – the yang wood horse specifically- and with it a fire-infused energy promoting growth, change, and progress.  After many years of reflection and preparation, we are finally moving into the generative, active part of the cycle accompanied by optimism, progress and innovation.  Brace yourself for fast-paced change, increased communication, emotional drama, activism, travel, impulsivity, speed, and inspiration.  Let this energy infuse you with a sense of purpose to follow your heart and achieve your goals!</p>
<p>As for this blog, my hope is to both share information from an eastern healing perspective and to promote dialogue, creating a forum for you to share your experience and ask questions.  In order to provide you the best care possible, I spend a lot of time staying current on best-practice protocols for specific conditions I treat, following current nutrition research, and staying on top of health and fitness trends and discoveries.  My goal is to share this information with you in order to help you make good choices about how to address your health concerns. I am excited to share what I learn in my day-to-day work, and to research topics that interest you &#8211; so please, use me!  Submit your questions or suggest topics that you’d like to learn more about.  I will gladly answer what I can, and seek out experts and good resources to help with what I can’t.  And if you’ve had an experience that’s greatly improved your state of health, please share.  Great change can be effected when we work together!  Thank you for being a part of the Thrive community.</p>
