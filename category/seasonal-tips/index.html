<p>Just as the earth cycles through the seasons, our energy ebbs and flows, prompting us to synchronize with nature&#8217;s rhythm and coordinate our actions with the cadence of the world we occupy. The fall season is a transition from abundance and outward exertion to inward consolidation and contemplation. In preparation for our winter slumber, we are asked to evaluate what to retain and what to cast aside before the next creative cycle begins. It is no coincidence that so many of the holidays this time of year focus on self-reflection, inward inventory, acknowledging ends, and embracing new beginnings. With each shedding of our old skin, the opportunity for growth increases.</p>
<p>We can feel the winds of change outside, briskly stirring up what is stale and rootless and clearing the space for a crisp new start. While on the surface things appear to be in a state of decline, this stark new landscape is actually a clean slate, full of untapped potential and endless possibility. As leaves start to whither and return to the earth, we too must turn from superficial distractions and reconnect with our core values and beliefs. This period of introspection marks a return home, asking us to begin the slow process of redefining our goals, reevaluating our choices, and connecting with our inherent talents and pressing ambitions.</p>
<p>Fall is the season of the lung, recipient and envoy of the vital force that keeps us alive and inspired. Each breathe is a new opportunity to receive, discern, and release, creating the tempo with which we live our lives and allowing us to be present, fully participating in every moment and experience. The element associated with fall is metal, illuminator of truth. It retains it&#8217;s integrity regardless of the conditions to which it is exposed and unassumingly reveals the elegance and power of simplicity. As we take cue and tune in to our most basic needs, we are given the opportunity for a complete re-set, shedding old beliefs in search of a more resonant truth.</p>
<p>While letting go of the past can be disquieting, it carries the promise of wisdom and insight as we cut the chains of old ideals and begin anew with clear resolve and a fresh sense of purpose. Let us use this precious time to gather our potential, separate out the extraneous and have the courage to become our most magnificent selves.</p>

It reveals you.&#8221; </em><em>&#8211; John Green, The Fault in Our Stars</em></p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine theory, every season has a corresponding spirit. The spirit of the fall is the Po &#8211; our corporeal soul. It is about movement, sensation, and the connection of our bodies to both our minds and to the world at large. It is what gives us animation, reaction, and human emotion. It governs our visceral responses and our capacity for sentiment and empathy.</p>
<p>The emotion associated with fall is grief. In Chinese medicine theory, grief is said to disrupt the flow of our qi, causing us to withdraw and disconnect with the world around us. As I often discuss in face reading sessions, grief is not only about death or the loss of a person. Our face reveals lines my teacher calls &#8220;lost love&#8221; that show up when we let a talent or creative passion lie dormant for too long. The body expresses this loss physically to illuminate the emotional blow felt by the spirit. There is also a collective sorrow that can be felt universally in response to world events that pull at our heartstrings. Regardless of the situation, in periods of emotional mourning we often go inward, retreating into our sadness as we ruminate in solitude waiting for the feelings to pass.</p>
<p>The Po allows us to receive and process our grief, even as our grief transforms us. It is the ability to both be and feel. By connecting us with our human urges, it lets us bring an experience into our being, receive the essential message, and ultimately move forward. It supports personal evolution within a world or space that might appear to have a very disparate agenda. Though we might experience tremendous change as a result of our own journey, the Po allows us to stay grounded in the world in which we reside and navigate the familiar from an internal place that might feel unchartered and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>While on any given day we are capable of all emotions, the seasonal cycle highlights and brings to the forefront those feelings or urges that can be addressed while we are in the strongest position to handle them. I urge you this fall to look at the things that might be causing you grief and harness the power of the season to catalyze your own personal revolution.</p>

<p>In Chinese Medicine theory, every season has a corresponding element, spirit, sound, flavor, network of channels, and set of energetic properties. In Spring, the element is Wood, the spirit is Hun (soul), and the energy is action, renewal, metamorphosis, and growth. Spring is the beginning of the new cycle of life, representing hope, creation, and the manifestation of dreams and potential. Just as the world around us is blooming and flowering, we too are called to express the notions of our souls and actualize the inspirations of our hearts.</p>
<p>The element of Wood, deriving from trees, is the symbol of expansion. With deep roots in the earth, it stretches is limbs far and wide, reaching for the sun, bending to the wind, and winding its way around any obstacles that cross its path. It does not strive for perfection. It simply holds steady through the storms and advances, undeterred, toward its highest potential. The self-assured aspect of ourselves, determined to stretch farther and aim higher, is supported by how much of this element we posses. The strength of our own personal Wood element is what gives us the stamina and resilience to create, self-actualize, achieve, and persist.</p>
<p>The Wood element is directly connected to vision &#8211; both literally and metaphorically. When properly nurtured through action, activity and unobstructed expression, our Wood energy provides us with creativity, foresight and clarity. It drives our ambition and provides us with the courage and stamina to implement our wildest ideas and execute our boldest creations. As Henry David Thoreau aptly states, <em>&#8220;In the long run men only hit what they aim for.&#8221;</em> Where will you set your sights this Spring, and how will you harness the energy of the season to bring your visions to life?</p>

Put him in the dark and he&#8217;ll never crow. I have seen the light and I&#8217;m crowing.&#8221; &#8211; Muhammad Ali</em></p>
<p>On January 28th &#8211; the Lunar New Year &#8211; we said goodbye to the capricious unpredictable Yang Fire Monkey and welcomed the more placid and practical Yin Fire Rooster. For many this calmer energy will be a welcome change. Roosters are characterized as organized, practical, decisive, territorial and particular. They posses strong ideals, are honest and critical, and value fidelity, punctuality, and proper behavior. They are leaders, who&#8217;s proud crow at dawn is a daily call to action, tirelessly commanding us to wake up and rise!</p>
<p>Because this is a yin-fire year there is an undercurrent of volatility, though it will not feel as chaotic as last year. Emotions will rise and reactivity will be heightened, but due to the changeability of fire, these bursts will be short-lived. Because there is a yin or feminine aspect to this fire, the change it provokes has the potential to be warm and healing. This symbolic light will help to illuminate unresolved conflict and hidden truths, allowing us to confront the darker aspects of ourselves and grow as a result. If we can fine-tune and articulate our own principles and ideologies while remaining open to others, there is great potential for personal elevation and social transformation.</p>
<p>Personally, this will be year of enhanced intuition, heightened communication, and emotional sentimentality. The flash of the fire element can bring on quick change of emotions, short-lived anger, fear and anxiety. We need to be wise about where we spend our energy and choose our fights with care. On the whole, people will be more warm-hearted, charismatic, and charming and it will be easier to find happiness in simple pleasures. There is an optimistic aspect to the fire element that encourages playfulness and joy. In this coming year, individual prosperity will come in the form of self-realization, group-oriented action, and small, quiet acts of kindness.</p>
<p>Socially, this will be an important year for community. As clashes in values and beliefs come the forefront we will start to see a restructuring of institutions and a shift in thoughts, actions and influence. Chickens are social animals, so during this time people will feel more connected to one other and find comfort in the gathering of like-minded individuals. There will be power in masses and change will come through collaboration and assembling together. Charismatic leaders will emerge and with them a revival of hope and renewal of strength.</p>

<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mortar-pestle.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-183" alt="mortar-pestle" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mortar-pestle-300x277.jpg" width="300" height="277" srcset="https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mortar-pestle-300x277.jpg 300w, https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mortar-pestle.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><em>&#8220;We are travelers on a cosmic journey, stardust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and whirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. We have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is a precious moment. It is a little parenthesis in eternity.&#8221; &#8211; Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist</em></p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine theory, every season has a corresponding element, whose qualities epitomize both the characteristics of that season and the aspect of our personality that allows us to thrive as we cycle through the earth&#8217;s energetic shifts. As Debra Kaatz so eloquently states in, Characters of Wisdom: Taoist Tales of the Acupuncture Points, &#8220;<em>The element of autumn is metal, the richness that lies within the earth. This is created by what remains of the harvest composting down and enriching the soil with mineral wealth. It also represents the rich gold we have inside that is enriched with the great inspirations of the heavens. Here both taking in and letting go is transformed into earthly gold and inner golden wisdom.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The metal element is aptly represented by the fall season, the time of year where things return to the earth to be repurposed or recreated. There is a shedding of old ideals, beliefs and baggage, and the powerful transformation that comes with the willingness to reduce something down to its purist form. Metal is often equated with alchemy, defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary as <em>1. a medieval chemical science and speculative philosophy aiming to achieve the transmutation of the base metals into gold, the discovery of a universal cure for disease, and the discovery of a means of indefinitely prolonging life; 2. a power or process of transforming something common into something special; 3. an inexplicable or mysterious transmuting.</em> Some of the many powers of metal are its ability to create boundaries, cut away the irrelevant, change shape, and be re-cast into something more purposeful while still retaining its essence. Both the elegance and the magic of metal is its ability to become more valuable and refined through the process of reduction and simplification.</p>
<p>People with a metal constitution tend to be honorable, virtuous, disciplined, and hold themselves to (sometimes impossibly) high standards and values. They appreciate beauty, simplicity, cleanliness, and serenity. A metal person requires minimal sensory input and seeks to clarify truth in its most pure and upright form. They are serious, dignified, and decisive in their actions. While they can often appear as aloof or cold, in fact they are extremely sensitive to nuance and small energetic shifts, particularly to the grief or sorrow of others. Because of their intuitive or empathic nature, they learn to set strong boundaries, and require and enjoy spending time alone in order to rebalance their energy. While their perfectionist nature can sometimes manifest as self-judgment, at their best, metal people will use their idealism and leadership skills to defend virtue and inspire the pursuit of higher standards and truth.</p>
<p>In this powerful season of transformation, it is encouraged that we all take stock of where we are in our journey and separate out what we no longer need to hold, accept, or endure. As we learn from the element of metal, great evolution and mastery can be achieved through reduction. It reminds me of one of my favorite exercises &#8211; for which I can&#8217;t find the original source &#8211; where before we speak we should ask ourselves: &#8220;is it true, is it necessary, is it kind?”. By revisiting our core values, we can reevaluate and repurpose our pursuits, realigning our actions with our heart&#8217;s own truth and living our lives to their fullest potential.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Coming, going, the waterbirds</em><br />
<em> don&#8217;t leave a trace,</em><br />
<em> don&#8217;t follow a path.&#8221;</em><br />
<em> &#8211; Dogen, On Non-Dependence of Mind</em></p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine Theory, Summer is the season of the Heart, of Fire, and of the Spirit. It is a time of illumination and great potential. I love this season because it is tied so deeply to hope and faith, to answering our calling and to reaching our fullest potential. One of my teachers says, &#8220;You only have so many heartbeats. How do you want to use them?&#8221; When we follow a path that aligns with our nature, the answer begins to materialize.</p>
<p>The Heart, in Chinese medicine, is referred to as the Emperor. It is said to house our Shen, or governing spirit, which allows us to understand our true nature and connect deeply with our personal purpose. This is the part of ourselves that is guided by our intuition and revealed by our whims. The heart does not command what it feels or pre-meditate its actions. It keeps us connected to the rhythm of life, able to relate to and communicate with those around us and experience each situation within it&#8217;s own context. When the heart channel is in balance, we feel a peacefulness of spirit, a tranquility of mind, and a clarity to the senses.</p>
<p>When the channel is out of balance we experience anxiety, insomnia, confusion and difficulty concentrating. Any sudden powerful emotional experience will overwhelm the heart, resulting in fright, shock, or emotional instability. We heal our mental suffering through the heart channel by balancing the emotions, calming the Shen and returning to a state of clarity. Allowing our hearts to heal is the only way to heal the spirit, and in doing so, we are better able to heal the whole.</p>

<em> &#8211; Thich Nhat Hanh</em></p>
<p>There is a symbiotic relationship between man and nature, both of which can thrive when we choose to live in harmony with the space that we occupy. Eating seasonally and locally is about much more than just being socially and environmentally conscious. The health implications can be quite profound.</p>
<p>In every season the foods that grow in our region have the added bonus of providing us with the taste and temperature properties that help our bodies adjust to the season. The cycle in which plants flower, and fruits and vegetables grow and ripen, corresponds with the changing needs of our bodies from season to season.</p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine theory, Spring is the season of the Liver meridan, who&#8217;s function is strongly associated with nourishment, movement, and the smooth flow of qi. When the channel is out of balance, symptoms such as anger, irritability, muscle aches and pain, stiff joints, spasms, headaches, red itchy eyes, constipation, and feelings of heat or agitation appear.</p>
<p>Foods that help to keep this channel system functioning well tend to be sour in flavor and green in color. Examples include citrus, berries, leeks, leafy greens, and vinegar. Conversely, greasy or spicy foods, alcohol, and amphetamines can have a negative impact on this channel system.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re feeling irritable or stuck, or allergies are stalling your momentum, try this simple but delicious spring recipe to help get your body back on track!</p>

<em>&#8211; Alan W. Watts</em></p>
<p>February 8, 2016 marked the beginning of the year of the Red Fire Monkey. As the explosive nature of the fire element meets the capricious trickery of the monkey, expect a lot of swift change and unpredictable outcomes.</p>
<p>Monkeys are playful and mischievous, full of both creativity and ingenuity. These attributes will come in especially handy in a red, fire year, where challenges can arise rapidly, but also be short-lived. Furthermore, the monkey is a metal element, which can clash with fire, causing conflicts and misunderstandings due to opposing energies. While this energy can feel chaotic or unstable, there is also the potential for profound transformation if we can stay steady in our focus and relinquish some control to the shifting tides.</p>
<p>Like all things disruptive, within the pandemonium lies the potential for wisdom<br />
and prosperity. The more creative and imaginative the endeavor we undertake at this time, the better the chance for unexpected success &#8211; particularly if we remain flexible and are willing to take risks. We might be feeling more impulsive this year, but equally more intuitive and communicative. The fire element will give our spirit and energy a boost, allowing us to laugh more easily at the monkey’s mischievous ways and perhaps take ourselves less seriously.</p>
<p>Energetically, the spring season aligns with the spirit of the fire monkey, a time<br />
for rebirth, growth, expansion, movement, and the re-awakening of the life process.<br />
It is the time of year to stretch our limbs, and our minds, and seek emotional equanimity by letting the qi flow freely and uninhibited. While the energy of the season puts us in a position to assert our ambition, it also provides us with the clarity of judgment to know when to let go. The better we modulate our intensity and stay flexible, the smoother the flow of liver qi. The smoother the flow of liver qi, the better we can handle whatever curve ball the monkey throws our way.</p>
<p>Since these rapid fluctuations can leave us feeling a bit scattered or anxious, we will be tested over this year in our ability to yield and greet each new wave with a sense of humor and a willingness to be patient and see where it takes us. Since Spring, as the Huang Di Nei Jing describes it, is a time when &#8220;the energy should be kept open and fluid,&#8221; by bending to the season, we are also better equipped to handle the greater cosmic challenges that cross our paths at the hands of that cheeky monkey.</p>

<p><em>Fate whispers to the warrior</em><br />
<em> &#8220;You cannot withstand the storm&#8221;</em><br />
<em> and the warrior whispers back</em><br />
<em> &#8220;I am the storm&#8221;                                                          &#8211; Author Unknown</em></p>
<p>In Chinese Medicine Theory, every season/channel/element is connected with a spirit. The spirit of the Kidney channel is called the <em>zhi.</em>  As outlined in the Huang di Nei Jing, &#8220;The Spirit of the Kidneys, the zhi, rules the will, desire, ambition, and survival instinct.&#8221;</p>
<p>As with everything, there is a yin and yang aspect to our <em>zhi</em>. The yang component is the more active side, representing effort, determination, and willpower. It is the motivational facet of our ambition &#8211; the putting forth of effort to bring us to our goals. When our kidney yang is weak, it leaves us passive and unassertive. When it is overactive or forced, we easily burn out or deplete ourselves.</p>
<p>The yin aspect to our <em>zhi</em> represents something deeper inside of us. It is a persistent, unconscious drive that guides our choices on a more spiritual level, aligned with our higher purpose or fate.  It is that little voice inside coaxing us gently in the right direction as it advocates for our inner truth. This more intangible part of our will is best accessed during self-reflection and meditation &#8211; activities encouraged during the winter season. When our kidney yin is weak, it causes a disturbance in this aspect of our spirit, inducing agitation, discontent, fear, and the inability to act.</p>
<p>When we can connect the yin and yang, focusing our efforts on answering to our true calling, our spirit is at peace. This requires the discipline to discover who we are at our core and the bravery to act congruently. By letting our instincts guide us, we can begin to align our actions with our inner awareness, bringing us closer to achieving our highest potential and living a more purposeful, fulfilling life.</p>

<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lotus-light.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-137" alt="lotus light" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lotus-light-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lotus-light-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.thriveacupunctureny.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lotus-light.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>As we say goodbye to 2015 and usher in the new year, we are presented with an opportunity to reflect on the past and evaluate how we&#8217;d like to move forward in the future. While many of us approach the new year with optimism, quite often as the minutia of our day-to-day lives takes over, we lose focus of our resolutions, falling back into old, comfortable patterns.</p>
<p>In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (Book 1, Pada 28), he discusses mantrum, &#8220;that which keeps the mind steady and produces the proper effect.&#8221; The idea is that constant repetition, or japa, of one specific word/goal/desire/action will create a habit, until eventually we &#8220;imbibe the qualities&#8221; of the thing we repeat.</p>
<p>Pada 32 reads, <i>Tat Pratisedhartham Eka Tattva Bhyasah, </i>&#8220;The practice of concentration on a single subject [or the use of one technique] is the best way to prevent the obstacles and their accompaniments.&#8221; In his discussion of this Pada, Sri Swami Satchidananda enforces that we must keep digging, or working at our goal, even if we encounter obstacles. Steadying the mind on the single object of our attention allows us to give it our full focus and power. This is not to say  obsess, but to stay on one track, so the bigger meaning and ultimate transformation can be revealed.</p>
<p>The idea that concentration is a practice rings very true for me. It requires that we are deliberate in our efforts. To simplify does not necessarily mean or goal is simple, but rather it is pure and undisrupted by distraction, fear and doubt.</p>
<p>He sums it up beautifully saying, &#8220;Stick to one thing and forge ahead with that. Why do you want to have this one-pointed concentration? To make the mind clear so you can transcend it. You are not going to cling to the object but just use it as a ladder to climb up. Once you have reached the roof you leave the ladder behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>So in thinking of New Years resolutions, perhaps this year we can all choose to focus on one thing that is really tugging at our hearts, and let this year be a practice in concentration on our ability to see it through.</p>
